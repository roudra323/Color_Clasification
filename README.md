Since each of the three RGB components (Red, Green, and Blue) can have values ranging from 0 to 255, this gives a total of 256 possible values (since 0 is included) for each component.

To find the total number of possible combinations of colors, you can multiply the number of possibilities for each component:

Total Combinations = 256 × 256 × 256 = 16,777,216

Thus, 16,777,216 unique color (16.7 million) combinations can be made using the RGB color model.


The project described, the RGB color classifier is designed to classify colors into 11 basic color categories: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Purple, Brown, Grey, Black, and White.
